# rainflow

rainflow is an R package designed to extract cyclic features from compressed time series. 
It offers a variety of compression algorithms and follows standard ATSM E1049-85 for calculating the mean and amplitude for each cycle.

## Installation

rainflow depends on R >= 3.3.3  
From R, run the following commands:  

```r
# rainflow is not yet on CRAN, so you will need the devtools package to install from GitHub
install.packages("devtools")

# Then install rainflow itself
devtools::install_github("addisonklinke/rainflow")
```

## Usage

See the sample `weather` dataset provided with the package for a general workflow

```r
data(weather)
p <- FindPeaks(weather$temp, R = 1.1, smooth = TRUE, window = 120)
r <- CountCycles(p)
summary(r)
plot(r)
```
